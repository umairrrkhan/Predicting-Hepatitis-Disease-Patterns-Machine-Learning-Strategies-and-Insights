# Predicting Hepatitis Disease Patterns: Machine Learning Strategies and Insights

Welcome to the "Predicting Hepatitis Disease Patterns" project! This project aims to predict hepatitis disease patterns using machine learning strategies and gain valuable insights from the dataset. In this README file, we'll cover the project overview, the libraries used, the dataset, and a step-by-step guide to running the code.

## Project Overview

Hepatitis is a significant public health concern worldwide. This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict hepatitis disease patterns, which can lead to early detection and better patient care. We'll explore a dataset containing relevant features and employ a Random Forest Classifier to build a predictive model.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- **numpy**: For numerical computations and array manipulation.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For enhancing the visual appeal of plots.
- **sklearn**: scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library, is used for data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is named `hepatitis_csv.csv`. It contains important features that help us understand and predict hepatitis disease patterns. The dataset likely includes attributes such as patient information, medical history, and test results.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umairrrkhan/Predicting-Hepatitis-Disease-Patterns-Machine-Learning-Strategies-and-Insights/tree/main
```

## Conclusion

This project is designed to help you understand how machine learning can be applied to predict hepatitis disease patterns. We use a Random Forest Classifier and explore essential features in the dataset. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to gain deeper insights or apply different machine learning algorithms.
